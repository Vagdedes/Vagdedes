## My approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* I actively use AI via API to provide support to my customers or automate other similar tasks.
* I also use AI in code editors and IDE software to auto-complete redundant code and thus save time.
* I am not a fan at all of using AI to generate code you do not understand, personally understanding is a greater priority than speed.
* I believe AI will revolutionize humanity's future and the purpose of human life, certainly causing chaos in such a transitionary phase.
* Unfortunately, AI will eventually take my job among many other jobs which is why I seek to master it, practically and theoretically.
* I am lastly concerned about the legal aspect of AI as it can and will be used maliciously by its users.
